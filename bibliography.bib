  abstract  = {SaaS providers continuously aim to optimize the cost-efficiency, scalability and trustworthiness of their offerings. Traditionally, these concerns have been addressed by application-level middleware platforms that implement a multi-tenant architecture.However, the recent uprise and industry adoption of container technology such as Docker and Kubernetes, exactly for the purpose of improving the cost-efficiency, elasticity and resilience of cloud native services, triggers the unanswered question whether and how container technology may affect such multi-tenant architectures.To answer this question, we outline our ideas on a container-based multi-tenant architecture for SaaS applications. Subsequently, we make an assessment of the technical Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) which should be taken into account by a SaaS provider when considering the adoption of such container-based architecture.},

  abstract  = {A widespread business model in cloud computing is to offer software as a service (SaaS) over the Internet. Such applications are often multi-tenant aware, which means that multiple tenants share hardware and software resources of the same application instance. However, SaaS stakeholders have different or even contradictious requirements and interests: For a user, the application's quality and non-functional properties have to be maximized (e.g., choosing the fastest available algorithm for a computation at runtime). In contrast, a resource or application provider is interested in minimizing the operating costs while maximizing his profit. Finally, tenants are interested in offering a customized functionality to their users. To identify an optimal compromise for all these objectives, multiple levels of variability have to be supported by reference architectures for multi-tenant SaaS applications. In this paper, we identify requirements for such a runtime architecture addressing the individual interests of all involved stakeholders. Furthermore, we show how our existing architecture for dynamically adaptive applications can be extended for the development and operation of multi-tenant applications.},
