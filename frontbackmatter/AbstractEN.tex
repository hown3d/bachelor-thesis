	\chapter*{Abstract}
	Large public cloud providers such as AWS, Google and Microsoft have a hard time with data protectionists:
	How to store sensitive data, as it can be chat messages, in a DSGVO compliant way.
	For this problem, the initiative Gaia-X was founded to offer a European cloud service.

	Gaia-X has had Plusserver Open Cloud since 2021, the first reference cloud for the future Gaia-X architecture,
	currently only offering infrastructure solutions such as \acp{VM}, storage and network. 
	Software services, like American hyperscaler clouds offer, are currently not implemented.
	Therefore, in this paper a new reference implementation for a chat \ac{SaaS} in a Gaia-X compatible cloud will be created.
	With a Software as a Service principle, the end-user should not have to worry about the operation, deployment
	or scaling of the application. 
	The \ac{SaaS} application is created as a container based solution using the defacto standard framework for 
	Kubernetes container orchestration \cite{Burns2019}. The advantage of this approach is the ease of scaling,
	a large ecosystem for Kubernetes as well as independence from cloud providers, 
	so that this architecture can be deployed on any infrastructure \cite{Burns2019}.

	The result of this work shows that a \ac{SaaS} for Gaia-X is already possible today, 
	although productive use and thus as competition for established American cloud providers is not yet achievable. 
	Gaia-X defines a standard for the creation of a federalized system and communication and interaction between participants. 
	The standard cannot yet be used effectively.
